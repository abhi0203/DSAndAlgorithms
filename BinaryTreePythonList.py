This code is to create a binary tree using Python list. 
Here in this case, the formula we use to treat a list as binary tree is 
- We mark the first element of the tree as None. We leave it as that for simplicity of the calculation purpose.
- We then start with second index or index 1 and use the formula leftNode = 2n and rightNode= 2n+1 where n is the index of the parent/ root node for the 2 child nodes
